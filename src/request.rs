//! Request objects for non-blocking operations
//!
//! Non-blocking operations such as `immediate_send()` return request objects that borrow any
//! buffers involved in the operation so as to ensure proper access restrictions. In order to
//! release the borrowed buffers from the request objects, a completion operation such as
//! [`wait()`](struct.Request.html#method.wait) or [`test()`](struct.Request.html#method.test) must
//! be used on the request object.
//!
//! **Note:** If the `Request` is dropped (as opposed to calling `wait` or `test` explicitly), the
//! program will panic.
//!
//! To enforce this rule, every request object must be registered to some pre-existing
//! [`Scope`](trait.Scope.html).  At the end of a `Scope`, all its remaining requests will be waited
//! for until completion.  Scopes can be created using either [`scope`](fn.scope.html) or
//! [`StaticScope`](struct.StaticScope.html).
//!
//! To handle request completion in an RAII style, a request can be wrapped in either
//! [`WaitGuard`](struct.WaitGuard.html) or [`CancelGuard`](struct.CancelGuard.html), which will
//! follow the respective policy for completing the operation.  When the guard is dropped, the
//! request will be automatically unregistered from its `Scope`.
//!
//! # Unfinished features
//!
//! - **3.7**: Nonblocking mode:
//!   - Completion, `MPI_Waitall()`, `MPI_Waitsome()`,
//!   `MPI_Testany()`, `MPI_Testall()`, `MPI_Testsome()`, `MPI_Request_get_status()`
//! - **3.8**:
//!   - Cancellation, `MPI_Test_cancelled()`
